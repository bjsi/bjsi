# About Me

My name is James. Many of the projects I work on are related to learning with [spaced repetition](https://www.experimental-learning.com/Concepts/SpacedRepetition) systems. Right now I'm focusing on creating plugins for SuperMemo and Obsidian, making [videos about free learning](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIaS9XDdQkvIjASBfgim1Uw) and [writing articles](https://www.experimental-learning.com/).

# Support

I want to put all of my energy into these projects and work on them full time! I also want to keep as much of my content open source and freely available as possible. That those seeking knowledge may find it!

If you would like to support my work, I have a [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/experimental_learning) with rewards for each tier or you can [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/experilearning).
