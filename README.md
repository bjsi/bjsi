# About Me

My name is James. Most of the projects I work on are related to free learning, [spaced repetition systems](https://www.experimental-learning.com/Concepts/SpacedRepetition) and [incremental reading](https://www.experimental-learning.com/SimpleGuru/IncrementalReading). Check out my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIaS9XDdQkvIjASBfgim1Uw) if you are interested in those topics. I also have some [messy notes and articles on my website](https://www.experimental-learning.com/). I recently started working at [RemNote](https://www.remnote.com).
